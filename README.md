# Learn-biology-Educational-game-for-children-about-genetics

Learn biology is an educational game that I developed for the subject programming foundations. 

The game has 4 mini-games which are: study the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a species, 
compare sequences of random bases, compare sequences, study the similarity between species. 

The programme makes use of FASTA files which is a file format used in biology to represent DNA, RNA or protein sequences.
